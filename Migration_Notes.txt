1. For all models, add the following to the top and let the models extend Model
namespace App\Models;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

2. For all models wich use softdeletes, use something like (SoftDeletes were changed abit)

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\SoftDeletes;

class Bbincidence extends Model
{
	/**
	 * Enabling soft deletes for specimen type details.
	 *
	 */
	use SoftDeletes;

2. To return to view from within controller, use View('view/name') instead of View::make()

3. To access models from within views (e.g., dashboard/home.phtml), use full namespace for the models. App\Models\Bbincidence::

4. In controllers, to access inputs: 
	- Add use Illuminate\Http\Request;
	- Functions/methods which consume imputs should take on instance of Request as a parameter e.g., public function index(Request $request)
	- The inputs can then be accessed as properties of Request i.e. $request->date_from
	
5. In Views with forms, to access preiviously sent information (in case of errors), use old() instead of Input::old() - the Input cass was removed from new laravel
	
6. Move the config files to the new location (at the root, not inside app anymore)

8. User the following link to configure Zizaco/entrust https://github.com/Zizaco/entrust

9. Move the language files from app to resources/lang

10. Move routes to routes/web.php
